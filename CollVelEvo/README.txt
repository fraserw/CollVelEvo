This code is a modified version of the collisional evolution code
that was used in Fraser 2009. Note:

1) This documentation is clearly incomplete.
2) This is not meant for production purposes as we are converting the
code to use pycuda, and correcting/improving the collisional outcome
routines.

If you want to know more about the code, don't download blindly! Rather,
please contact the author, Wesley Fraser at
